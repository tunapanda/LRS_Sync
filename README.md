# LRS_Sync
Small Python program that syncs statements between two LRSs.

Currently only allows pushing of statements from one LRS (local) to another (remote). Will check for existing statements to avoid duplicates.

Add LRS authentication information to LRS_config_template.py and rename to LRS_config.py and run LRS_Sync.py
